    "\n",
    "Ans: Machine learning Popularly known as ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values."

    "Ans: If the model performs poorly to new instances, then it has overfitted on the training data. To solve this, we can do any of the following three:\n",

    "Get more data\n",
    "Implement a simpler model\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: Cross-validation is a tool to compare models without needing a separate validation set. It is preferred over validation set because we can save from breaking of part of the training set to create a validation set, as having more data is valuable regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: If you tune hyperparameters using the test sets, then it may not perform well on the out-of-sample data because the model is tuned just for that specific set."
